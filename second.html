                    About Them
            </h1>
    <p style="color:#2196f3;">This season, TreVeyon Henderson has been a ray of joy. He was selected in the second round and has already displayed signs of big play ability, including quick bursts of speed, long explosive runs, and a natural ability to find the endzone. He joined a select group in Patriots history as the second rookie to score three touchdowns in a single game behind Patriots Hall of Famer Rob Gronkowski. 
 Fans believed that Henderson's 55 and 69 yard runs were the kind of explosive lift that this team desperately needed. He appears to have the ability to alter the offense's identity, which is why there is genuine excitement.</p>
    <p style="color:#2196f3;">Will Campbell has calmly performed one of the toguhest jobs as a rookie offensive lineman, and that is protecting your quarterbacks blindslide. Expectations were high when the rookie left tackle was selected fourth overall. Although he has experienced ups and downs, as many rookies do, he has demonstrated and the determination you look for in a top pick.  Even when the  offensive line has been put to the test, Campbell's name continues to be mentioned. Even with him going up against some elite pass rushers in the leauge. For a team attempting to rebuild its foundation, having a young tackle who can protect the quarterback and anchor the line is a significant victory.</p>

    <p style="color:#2196f3;">
        There's also Kyle Williams. Although he hasn't yet lit up the stat sheet as a 2025 third-round pick, there is plenty potential. His work ethic and physical attributes are being recognized and he has already set a high speed record for a Patriots rookie at 21.78 mph.  Even though he still has few snaps and catches, the hype around him indicates that the coaching staff believes he has potential. Fans view Williams as a "wait-and-see" asset with upside.
